This is a fourth year assignment for 3D Interfaces where I create a 3D driving simulator using OpenSceneGraph. 
Required to create a custom 3D scene that demonstrates the following aspects of OSGJS:
- Scene graph design(Group nodes, Shape nodes)
- Custom geometry
- Lighting
- Texture mapping
- Action
- Interaction
